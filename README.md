# ShopSquad
ShopSquad is just a proof of concept at this point and is in no way ready for real-world use.

The end goal is to create an easy to use shop managmenet application aimed at the heavy truck/trailer repair industry. Some of the pain-points I'm aiming to solve here are... (These are just written down as they come to mind and will be organized and revised later)
- Effortless communication with customers
  - Customer requsts for service/estimate
  - Shop can send estimates and recieve approval via email
  - Estimate review consultaions in real-time with the customer
  - Repair order story/notes updates sent to the customer when they are added to the repair-order
  - A chat feature the customer can use on a per-repair-order basis to inquire about additional updates or information
- Simple repair order creation
- Easy technician workflow
  - Work can be assigned to a technician and they can view work to be done in their queue
  - Techinicians can clock-in and off jobs/repair line items to track labor hours
  - A chat feature between the technician and service advisor for simple communication
- More to be added!
